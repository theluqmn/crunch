## extras

i wanted to work on a slightly more complicated project than my previous one, [wareball](https://github.com/theluqmn/wareball) (an inventory management system), so i started crunch. i named this project 'crunch' because my girlfriend was eating fried chicken and i heard the crunch sounds - so yeah.
